The following sections describe the options available for improving the security of your etcd deployment.

### Configure RBAC

In order to enable Role-Based Access Control for etcd, set the following parameters:

~~~
auth.rbac.enabled=true
auth.rbac.rootPassword=YOUR-PASSWORD
~~~

These parameters create a *root* user with an associate *root* role with access to everything. The remaining users will use the *guest* role and won't have permissions to do anything.

### Configure certificated for peer communication

In order to enable secure transport between peer nodes, deploy the chart with these options:

~~~
auth.peer.secureTransport=true
auth.peer.useAutoTLS=true
~~~

### Configure certificates for client communication

In order to enable secure transport between client and server, create a secret containing the certificate and key files and the CA used to sign the client certificates. In this case, create the secret and then deploy the Helm chart with these options:

~~~
auth.client.secureTransport=true
auth.client.enableAuthentication=true
auth.client.existingSecret=etcd-client-certs
~~~
