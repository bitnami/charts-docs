The Bitnami etcd Helm chart supports automatic disaster recovery by periodically snapshotting the keyspace. If the cluster permanently loses more than (N-1)/2 members, it tries to recover the cluster from a previous snapshot.

Enable this feature with the following parameters:

~~~
persistence.enabled=true
disasterRecovery.enabled=true
disasterRecovery.pvc.size=2Gi
disasterRecovery.pvc.storageClassName=nfs
~~~

If the *startFromSnapshot.\** parameters are used at the same time as the *disasterRecovery.\** parameters, the PVC provided via the *startFromSnapshot.existingClaim* parameter will be used to store the periodical snapshots.

> NOTE: Disaster recovery feature requires volumes with ReadWriteMany access mode.

Learn more about this feature in our [tutorial on backing up and restoring Bitnami etcd chart deployments on Kubernetes](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/backup-restore-data-etcd-kubernetes/).
