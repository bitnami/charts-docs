To add a new node to your etcd deployment, upgrade your installation by providing the number of nodes you want to add to the *helm upgrade* command as follows:

~~~
$ helm upgrade my-release bitnami/etcd \
  --set statefulset.replicaCount=NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS
~~~

> NOTE: Remember to replace the NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS placeholder with the total number of nodes required in the cluster.
