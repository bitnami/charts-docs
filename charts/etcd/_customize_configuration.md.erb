In order to use custom configuration parameters, two options are available:

* Environment variables: The Helm chart accepts environment variables that map to configuration settings. In order to set extra environment variables, use the *envVarsConfigMap* value to point to a Kubernetes ConfigMap (shown in the below example) that contains them.

This ConfigMap can be created as shown below. The chart can then be deployed with the *envVarsConfigMap=CONFIGMAP-NAME* parameter, where CONFIGMAP-NAME refers to the name of the created ConfigMap (in this example, *etcd-env-vars*)

```console
$ cat << EOF > /tmp/configurationEnvVars.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: etcd-env-vars
  namespace: default
data:
  ETCD_AUTO_COMPACTION_RETENTION: "0"
  ETCD_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL: "150"
EOF
```

* Custom *etcd.conf.yml*: The chart supports mounting a custom *etcd.conf.yml* file as a ConfigMap and deploying it using the *configFileConfigMap=CONFIGMAP-NAME* parameter, where CONFIGMAP-NAME refers to the name of the created ConfigMap.
